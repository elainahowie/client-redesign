# client-redesign

Client documentation

I currently work for the University of Minnesota’s Academic Support Resources (ASR) communications team. Later this semester, I will be working with my boss and a few other members of our team to reconfigure/redesign the One Stop Student Services website (onestop.umn.edu). I thought this project would fit well with what we are learning in class so for my project, I am going to be coming up with a concept landing page for a new One Stop website. My client is my boss at ASR and I will be meeting with him to talk about ideas for the website and will show him a finished product at the end of the project that we will hopefully be able to use when we redesign the actual One Stop page. 
During our meeting my boss and I discussed the problems with the current website and some of our goals for how the new landing page will look. 

Problems with the current site:
-Layout 
-Colors
-Picture (background)
-Dropdown menus

We think that the top of the site that houses all the menus isn’t a huge issue but could use a little re-working. The drop-down menus however are quite busy and have a different theme than the rest of the site. 
The bulk of the site isn’t very visually appealing - the background image is not working in the site’s favor and the blue boxes (links) are a bit of an eyesore against the background image. This needs to be cleaned up. I think a more minimalistic feel would be better because it is currently over saturated with color, links, and random text. It needs a new flow and a general clean-up. 

Process Documentation

Documents the student's process for acquiring (or expanding) understanding of HTML (clear, understandable companion document to the assignment). Indicates familiarity with Duckett text, and/or Lynda HTML resource use.
I had worked very minimally with HTML before this class. I knew that most websites were housed using HTML, I had used HTML very minimally in my internship, but I had never started from scratch and made my own website or anything of the sort. This was a decently daunting project to me because of my lack of expertise and experience. However, after reading the readings and working in class I became a little more familiar and a bit more confident. 
For the project, I knew my client would not be using my actual site. Instead, they needed a concept site to model their new one off of. My client uses Drupal 8 and Drupal Lite so when it is time to actually redesign the website, we will be using those tools. So, I needed to create a sort of template for them to go off of to keep in mind and to use when they actually redesign the site. Keeping this all in mind,  I decided to use a template for this redesign.
At first, I had quite a bit of difficulty with this project. I had downloaded a template and plugged a few things in a few days before the peer review and thought it was going just fine. Then I started working on it again and I completely broke the page. I spent the next few days trying to fix that and recover what I had broken. Unfortunately it did not work at all. I still have no idea what I did. Because of this, I decided to completely start over. Once I started over, it went much smoother. I had a few ideas for the site that I thought were important that I really wanted to include in the project - I wanted the navigation bar at the top to have drop down menus and show/hides within the menus to the different links on the page. However, I could not figure out how to do that before the deadline so I ended up putting that idea on hold. I am planning on figuring that out in the future so I will know how to do it. 
To summarize, my process for this project was as follows:
Created the repository, downloaded the template, input the information from my client’s previous website, published the repository.
